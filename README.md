A particle code and associated python code for an internet connected  beehive. 

Several sensors equip the beehive and are inputs of a particle core.
The main sensor is the output of a modified bathroom scale that delivers the weight.
Temperature, hygrometry, noise in the beehive, luminosity are also sensed.
The data are published on the cloud (here Keen_IO) to be stored permanently. 
They are downloaded on request by a python code that plot the different parameters.
